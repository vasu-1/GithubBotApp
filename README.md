- It is a GitHub app for automating the GitHub workflow. It is made using Python. 
- It is using gidgethub Library for communicating to the GitHub events. 
- Bot uses various type of GitHub events and does stuff according to that event. 
- This bot can be used in various type of events like if we are hosting an event for any coding stuff on a large scale than we can use this type of bots for making out event more interesting.
- You don't need to install or configure stuff manually, because I have hosted it on GitHub and anyone can use this app in their repository with only one click !!
